### Proof Of Concept - Pub / Sub
Here we use RabbitMQ to send and recieve messages between services in context of publish / subcribe pattern.
In order to build this target you need these libraries and services:   

  * [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server) 
  * [RabbitMQ C Client](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c)
  * [RabbitMQ C++ Client](https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient)
